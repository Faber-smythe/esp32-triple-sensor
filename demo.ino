 * 
 *  CLIMATE SENSOR
 * 
 *  [this is an entry point for the Arduino sketch and contains no actual code]
 *  
 *  Compilation calls all .ino files in the sketch in a specific order (same order than the tabs displayed in Arduino IDE) :
 *    - first the file having the same name as the sketch (the folder wherein the files live)
 *    - then all the other .ino files, in alphabetical order
 *    
 *  This is why this initial file is empty. The pattern used is "demo_a_[first-file]", "demo_b_[second-file]", etc.
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  /!\ This sketch was made for ESP-32. Please download the Board Manager following a guide like this one :
 *  https://www.hackster.io/abdularbi17/how-to-install-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-1cd571
 *  If you want to use the serial monitor, don't forget the ESP-32 usually runs at a 115200 Baudrate
 *
